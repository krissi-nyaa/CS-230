## Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
The mock client in this scenario wanted a back-end client for their game. They wanted something that would allow people to connect to other people in an online game. For this, we designed an API.

## What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
I believe I analyzed the client's requirements well and created very intricate recommendations that would help them in the long-run. A lot of the design choices I made were best-practices for helping smaller companies or groups manage web APIs.

## What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
The design documents help A LOT when writing code. By preparing the high-level needs of the program in advance, the coding process is more focused and typically less error-prone.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would expand on the design diagrams to show how the program works in entirety rather than in pieces. Usually I create a document with 'layers' where clients can view how things work in different levels such as functionality-based diagrams, process-based, and so on...

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
The user's needs were key to the design recommendations I made. Things like targeting multiple platforms and the functional requirements of how users consume the platform guided my decisions when designing the recommendations.

## How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I used my knowledge of common best-practices and experiences with various deployment options to guide the client in the right direction for what would work best in their use-case. I considered the user's needs as well as the client's demands to create a compromise between what works best, what the users want, and what the client needs.
